# Word2Vec

Word2Vec is a popular algorithm for learning vector representations of words from large datasets of text. It was introduced in a 2013 paper by Tomas Mikolov and his colleagues at Google.

The basic idea behind Word2Vec is to learn a low-dimensional vector representation, or embedding, for each word in a corpus. These embeddings are learned by training a neural network on a large corpus of text, with the objective of predicting the context in which each word appears.

There are two main types of Word2Vec models: 

**1. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** - In the CBOW model, the objective is to predict the current word based on its context (the surrounding words).

**2. Skip-gram** - In the Skip-gram model, the objective is to predict the surrounding words given the current word.

Once the Word2Vec model has been trained, the embeddings can be used in a variety of natural language processing tasks. For example, they can be used as input to a neural network for text classification or sentiment analysis, or they can be used to compute the similarity between two words.

Word2Vec has become a widely-used technique in natural language processing and machine learning due to its ability to capture semantic relationships between words. Words that are similar in meaning tend to have similar vector representations, which allows the model to capture subtle nuances of meaning in natural language.
